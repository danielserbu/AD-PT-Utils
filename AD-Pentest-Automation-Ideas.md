# AD Penetration Testing Automation Ideas

## Overview
This document outlines potential automation opportunities for Active Directory penetration testing, based on the tools available in the toolkit. These automation scripts would complement existing tools (NetExec Wrapper, Kerberoasting Automation, and Impacket Toolkit) to create a comprehensive AD pentesting framework.

  - Configure and manage ntlmrelayx for credential relay
  - Automate exploitation of captured credentials
  - Integration with credential management system
- **Tools Leveraged**: Impacket (ntlmrelayx), Responder
- **Certification Relevance**: Important for initial access in all certifications

### 6. SecLists-Based Discovery Framework
- **Purpose**: Intelligent application of wordlists for various discovery tasks
- **Key Features**:
  - Context-aware selection of appropriate wordlists
  - Automated content discovery for web applications
  - Custom wordlist generation based on target organization
  - Integration with brute force and password spraying tools

### 7. Combined Credential Harvesting and Cracking Pipeline
- **Purpose**: End-to-end automation of credential extraction and cracking
- **Key Features**:
  - Unified interface for multiple credential harvesting techniques
  - Automated selection of appropriate hashcat modes and rules
  - Progress tracking and result management
  - Feedback loop to feed cracked credentials back into scanning
- **Tools Leveraged**: Hashcat, John the Ripper, Impacket, custom scripts
- **Certification Relevance**: Critical for credential attacks in all certifications

### 8. Unified Lateral Movement Framework
- **Purpose**: Streamline movement through the network with multiple techniques
- **Key Features**:
  - Single interface for executing commands via multiple protocols
  - Automatic selection of best movement technique based on context
  - Session management and persistence
  - Automatic mapping of accessed systems
- **Tools Leveraged**: Impacket (psexec, wmiexec, dcomexec), PowerShell scripts
- **Certification Relevance**: Essential for lateral movement in all certifications

### 9. AD Certificate Services Attack Tool
- **Purpose**: Automate attacks against Active Directory Certificate Services
- **Key Features**:
  - Enumerate certificate templates and enrollment services
  - Identify and exploit vulnerable certificate templates
  - Automate ESC1-ESC8 attack scenarios
  - Certificate-based persistence techniques
- **Tools Leveraged**: Certify, custom scripts
- **Certification Relevance**: Advanced topic in C-ADPenX

### 10. Situational Awareness Collector
- **Purpose**: Gather and correlate information about the target environment
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated collection of host and network information
  - Correlation of data from multiple sources
  - Visual representation of the network environment
  - Identification of critical infrastructure and vulnerabilities
- **Tools Leveraged**: Scripts from the situational_awareness folder, custom scripts
- **Certification Relevance**: Foundational for all certifications

## Implementation Priorities

For PNPT, CRTS, and C-ADPenX certifications, the following implementation order is recommended:

1. **PowerShell-Based Enumeration Framework** - Foundational for initial reconnaissance
2. **BloodHound Automation Script** - Critical for attack path visualization
3. **Mimikatz Wrapper** - Essential for credential harvesting
4. **Unified Lateral Movement Framework** - Key for moving through the environment
5. **Combined Credential Harvesting and Cracking Pipeline** - For comprehensive credential attacks

## Integration with Existing Tools

These new automation scripts should integrate with the existing toolkit:
- Share the same configuration file structure
- Use consistent logging and output formats
- Maintain the same command-line interface patterns
- Feed results between tools as part of a comprehensive workflow

## Notes for Development

When implementing these automation scripts:
- Prioritize modularity to allow individual components to be used independently
- Implement extensive error handling for reliability during exams
- Include detailed logging for documentation and reporting
- Consider OPSEC (Operational Security) to minimize detection during exams
