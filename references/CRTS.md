   - Leveraging C2 frameworks like Cobalt Strike.

### 5. **Lateral Movement**
   - Techniques such as Pass-the-Hash and exploiting trust relationships.
   - Using tools like CrackMapExec and Impacket.

### 6. **Data Exfiltration**
   - Extracting sensitive data while evading detection.
   - Encrypting traffic to bypass monitoring tools.
