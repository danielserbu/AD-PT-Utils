# Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) - Study and Automation Guide

## **Overview**
The PNPT certification validates skills in network penetration testing, including reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within enterprise environments. It emphasizes real-world scenarios over theoretical knowledge.

---

## **Exam Details**
- **Duration**: 5 days (practical exam)
- **Format**: Online, on-demand
- **Environment**: Simulated corporate network
- **Pass Criteria**:
  - Completion of objectives within the time frame.
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Basic understanding of networking concepts and penetration testing methodologies.

---

## **Exam Syllabus**
### 1. **External Reconnaissance**
   - OSINT techniques for identifying external assets.
   - DNS enumeration and subdomain discovery using tools like Amass.

### 2. **Exploitation of External Services**
   - Discovering vulnerabilities in exposed services (e.g., SSH, SMB).
   - Exploiting web application flaws such as SQL injection or XSS.

### 3. **Internal Network Testing**
   - Pivoting into internal networks post-compromise.
   - Scanning for open ports/services using Nmap or Nessus.

### 4. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Exploiting misconfigurations in Windows/Linux environments.
   - Credential harvesting from memory or file systems.

### 5. **Lateral Movement**
   - Moving across the network using compromised credentials or tokens.
   - Techniques like Pass-the-Ticket or exploiting trust relationships.

## **Skills to Master**
1. External reconnaissance with tools like Amass or Sublist3r.
2. Vulnerability exploitation of common services (e.g., RDP, SMB).
3. Privilege escalation through kernel exploits or misconfigurations.
4. Lateral movement within internal networks using compromised credentials.

## **Tools to Learn**
- Amass/Sublist3r: Subdomain enumeration tools.
- Nmap/Nessus: Scanning for open ports/services.
- Metasploit Framework: Exploitation platform.
- BloodHound/SharpHound: Mapping Active Directory attack paths.

---

## **Automation Opportunities**
1. Automate OSINT data collection with Python scripts for subdomain discovery.
2. Use Nmap scripting engine (NSE) for automated vulnerability detection workflows.
3. Write custom scripts to identify privilege escalation vectors on Linux/Windows systems.

## **Learning Resources**
1. Hands-on Labs:
   - RangeForce Labs for network penetration testing scenarios.
2. Recommended Courses:
   - "Practical Ethical Hacking" by TCM Security
3. Books/Blogs:
   - "The Hacker Playbook" series by Peter Kim
   - Offensive Security's "Metasploit Unleashed."

## **Final Notes**
Success in the PNPT certification requires a focus on practical skills over theoretical knowledge while leveraging automation to streamline reconnaissance and exploitation processes during engagements.
