# Certified Active Directory Pentesting Expert (C-ADPenX) - Study and Automation Guide

## **Overview**
The C-ADPenX certification validates expertise in Active Directory (AD) security, focusing on penetration testing and defense of AD environments. It is a rigorous, hands-on certification designed for experienced professionals in cybersecurity, particularly penetration testers, red teamers, and AD administrators.

## **Exam Details**
- **Duration**: 7 hours (practical exam)
- **Format**: Online, on-demand
- **Environment**: Simulated AD infrastructure via VPN
- **Pass Criteria**:
  - 60%: Pass
  - 75%: Pass with Merit
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Minimum 5 years of professional pentesting or red teaming experience.
  - Strong knowledge of AD exploitation, Windows security, and privilege escalation.

## **Exam Syllabus**
### 1. **Active Directory Reconnaissance**
   - Mapping domain environments, forests, and trusts.
   - Enumerating users, groups, and system details using tools like PowerView and BloodHound.

### 2. **Credential Harvesting and Attacks**
   - Capturing and cracking password hashes.
   - Exploiting Kerberos (Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting) and NTLM vulnerabilities.
   - Password spraying and attacking weak authentication mechanisms.

### 3. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Exploiting misconfigured AD objects.
   - Leveraging vulnerabilities in Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS).
   - Abusing tokens, user privileges, and nested group memberships.

### 4. **Persistence Techniques**
   - Implementing long-term footholds through service accounts or delegated permissions.
   - Exploiting overlooked AD features for advanced persistence.

### 5. **Lateral Movement**
   - Techniques like Pass-the-Ticket, Pass-the-Hash, and exploiting trust relationships across domains.
   - Using tools like Mimikatz for credential extraction.

### 6. **Domain and Forest Compromise**
   - Gaining control over domain controllers (DCs).
   - Offline extraction of NTDS databases.
   - Manipulating AD configurations for full forest compromise.

## **Skills to Master**
1. **Active Directory Enumeration**:
   - Tools: BloodHound, PowerView, SharpHound.
2. **Exploitation Techniques**:
   - Kerberos attacks (e.g., Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket).
   - NTLM relay attacks.
3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Misconfigured ACLs/DACLs.
   - Exploiting Group Policies and ADCS vulnerabilities.
4. **Post-exploitation Tactics**:
   - Persistence through service accounts or GPO manipulation.
5. **Lateral Movement**:
   - Techniques like RDP hijacking or exploiting inter-domain trust relationships.
6. **Command & Control (C2)**:
   - Frameworks: Covenant, Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation activities.

## **Tools to Learn**
- BloodHound: Visualizing AD attack paths.
- Mimikatz: Credential dumping and manipulation.
- PowerView/SharpHound: Enumeration of AD environments.
- CrackMapExec: Automating credential validation and exploitation workflows.
- Impacket Suite: For lateral movement (e.g., Pass-the-Ticket).
- Responder: Capturing NTLM hashes via LLMNR poisoning.

## **Automation Opportunities**
1. **Reconnaissance Automation**:
   - Use PowerShell scripts for automated user/group enumeration.
2. **Credential Harvesting**:
   - Automate Kerberoasting with Impacketâ€™s `GetUserSPNs.py`.
3. **Privilege Escalation Detection**:
   - Write scripts to identify misconfigured ACLs or vulnerable GPOs using LDAP queries.
4. **Persistence Deployment**:
   - Automate backdoor creation in service accounts or GPOs using custom scripts.
5. **Lateral Movement Simulation**:
   - Automate Pass-the-Ticket/Hash attacks with CrackMapExec or Impacket tools.
